Based on the bar graph in the provided PNG file, here are three notable trends:

Yearly Increase in Total Sales: There is a clear upward trend in total sales each year from 2010 to 2013. Sales have risen consistently year over year.

Doubling of Sales Over Three Years: The total sales more than doubled in this three-year period. The sales in 2010 are less than half of what they are in 2013.

Accelerating Growth Rate: The increase in sales from 2010 to 2011 is significant, but the growth rate appears to accelerate in the following years. The jump in sales from 2011 to 2012 and from 2012 to 2013 is larger than the previous year's growth. This could indicate an accelerating demand or success in the market.
