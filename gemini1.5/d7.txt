Notable Trends in Revenue Data:

Based on the provided data, here are ten notable trends:

Growth & Seasonality:

1. Overall Growth: There is a general upward trend in total revenue from 2010 to 2013. 
2. Strong Start in 2011: Revenue skyrocketed in January 2011 compared to December 2010, showing a massive initial growth spurt.
3. Mid-Year Peaks: Revenue tends to peak in the middle of the year, particularly in June, across multiple years.
4. Summer Slump: Following the peak, there is often a dip in revenue during July and August.
5. End-of-Year Increase: Revenue generally rises again towards the end of the year, culminating in December.

Volatility & Fluctuations:

6. Significant Month-to-Month Fluctuations: While there is an overall upward trend, there are considerable month-to-month fluctuations in revenue, with both sharp increases and decreases.
7. High Volatility in Early 2012: The first quarter of 2012 shows particularly high volatility, with a significant drop in January followed by a sharp rise in February and another major drop in March.
8. More Stable Growth in 2013: While fluctuations still occur, 2013 demonstrates a more stable and consistent growth pattern compared to previous years.

Specific Observations:

9. Dramatic Drop in January 2014: The data for January 2014 shows a dramatic drop in revenue compared to December 2013. This could be an anomaly, a seasonal effect, or indicative of a larger trend; further data is needed for conclusive analysis.
10. Possible Data Error: The lack of data for "PREV_MONTH_REVENUE" in December 2010 might be an error, as it hinders the calculation of growth percentage for January 2011. 

These trends suggest a business with strong seasonal influences and some volatility. Further analysis with additional data points and external factors could provide deeper insights into the underlying causes and potential future performance.
