1. There is a positive correlation between sales amount quota and total sales. This means that as the sales amount quota increases, the total sales also tend to increase. 
2. The relationship between sales amount quota and total sales is not linear. This means that the increase in total sales is not proportional to the increase in sales amount quota. 
3. There is a large amount of variation in total sales for any given sales amount quota. This means that other factors besides the sales amount quota are also important in determining total sales. 

Score:
1. 3
2. 0 (The relationship seems fairly linear with the exception of some outliers)
3. 2 (I mean I guess? Theres only a large amount of variation when the quota is 0, otherwise it seems to be ina fairly tight band)
