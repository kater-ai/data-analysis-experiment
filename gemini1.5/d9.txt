There is a general upward trend in total sales over the years. This is particularly noticeable in 2013, where total sales consistently exceed those of previous years.
Sales quotas seem to be set quite high, leading to most individuals falling short of their targets. This is reflected in the predominantly negative "Sales Minus Quota" values.
There is significant variability in individual performance. Some individuals consistently achieve high sales figures, while others struggle to meet expectations.
The data suggests potential seasonality in sales, with Q4 being the strongest period. This could be due to various factors like holiday seasons or end-of-year promotions.
