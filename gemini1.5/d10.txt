Notable trends in the sales data:

1. High Variability: The daily total sales show high variability throughout the year, with frequent spikes and dips. This suggests inconsistent sales patterns and potential influence of external factors.

2. No Clear Seasonality: While there are some fluctuations, the data doesn't exhibit a clear seasonal trend (e.g., higher sales in specific months). This indicates that other factors might be driving sales more than seasonal changes.

3. Occasional Large Spikes: Some days show exceptionally high sales compared to the surrounding days. These outliers could be due to specific promotions, events, or other anomalies. 

4. Moving Average Smooths Out Fluctuations: The moving average provides a smoother view of the sales trend by averaging out daily fluctuations. It reveals underlying patterns that are not readily apparent in the daily sales data.

5. Moving Average Shows Some Upward Trend: While not dramatic, the moving average suggests a slight upward trend in sales over the year. This could indicate slow but steady growth in the business.

6. Periods of Relative Stability: There are periods where the moving average remains relatively stable for several weeks, suggesting periods of consistent sales performance.

7. Sales tend to cluster around specific values: There seem to be clusters of sales around specific values, particularly around 2049 and 4492. This could be related to product pricing or sales strategies.

8. Lower Sales in February: Compared to other months, February shows a noticeable dip in both total sales and the moving average. This could be due to seasonal factors, fewer business days, or specific events impacting sales.

9. Highest Sales in March and December: Both March and December show instances of the highest total sales figures. This could be related to holiday seasons, promotional activities, or specific product launches.

10. Moving Average Doesn't Predict Future Sales Perfectly: While the moving average can help identify trends, it doesn't perfectly predict future sales due to the inherent variability in the data. 

These are just some of the notable trends in the data. Further analysis with additional information (e.g., product categories, marketing campaigns) could provide deeper insights into the driving forces behind these trends.
